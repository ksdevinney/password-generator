# Password Generator

This application uses Javascript in order to create a randomized password based on user criteria. Passwords can be any length between 8-128 characters, and can include special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.

## Function

Upon clicking "generate password," the user will be prompted to select which characters types they would like to include. If the user selects no types, an error will display. Any selected types will be randomized to the desired length, guaranteeing a unique and secure password. If the user requests a password length less than 8, greater than 128, or inputs a non-numerical response, a password will not generate. 

## Development

This application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The assignment criteria required the development of JavaScript code that would store values in different arrays, prompt the user to select password requirements, run a for loop to the requested length with random selected values, and write the result to the password field. 

This repository includes a video of the application in use, as well as a preview of a generated password.
